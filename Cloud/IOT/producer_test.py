# Purpose:
#
#    Demonstrate the use of Kafka Python streaming APIs.
#    In this example, we use the "top" command and use it as producer of events for
#    Kafka. The consumer can be another Python program that reads and dumps the
#    information into a database OR just keeps displaying the incoming events on the
#    command line consumer (or consumers)
#

import os   # need this for popen
import time # for sleep
from kafka import KafkaProducer  # producer of events
from kafka import KafkaConsumer
# We can make this more sophisticated/elegant but for now it is just
# hardcoded to the setup I have on my local VMs

# acquire the producer
# (you will need to change this to your bootstrap server's IP addr)
producer = KafkaProducer (bootstrap_servers="apachekafka-service:9092", 
                                          acks=1)  # wait for leader to write to log

# say we send the contents 100 times after a sleep of 1 sec in between
for i in range (100):
    
    # get the output of the top command
    process = os.popen ("top -n 1 -b")

    # read the contents that we wish to send as topic content
    contents = process.read ()

    # send the contents under topic utilizations. Note that it expects
    # the contents in bytes so we convert it to bytes.
    #
    # Note that here I am not serializing the contents into JSON or anything
    # as such but just taking the output as received and sending it as bytes
    # You will need to modify it to send a JSON structure, say something
    # like <timestamp, contents of top>
    #
    producer.send ("utilizations", value=bytes (contents, 'ascii'))
    producer.flush ()   # try to empty the sending buffer

    # sleep a second
    time.sleep (1)

# we are done
producer.close ()
    

consumer = KafkaConsumer (bootstrap_servers="apachekafka-service:9092")

# subscribe to topic
consumer.subscribe (topics=["utilizations"])
f=open('consumed.txt','w')
# we keep reading and printing
for msg in consumer:
    # what we get is a record. From this record, we are interested in printing
    # the contents of the value field. We are sure that we get only the
    # utilizations topic because that is the only topic we subscribed to.
    # Otherwise we will need to demultiplex the incoming data according to the
    # topic coming in.
    #
    # convert the value field into string (ASCII)
    #
    # Note that I am not showing code to obtain the incoming data as JSON
    # nor am I showing any code to connect to a backend database sink to
    # dump the incoming data. You will have to do that for the assignment.
    message =str(msg.value, 'ascii')
    print(message)
    f.write(message+"\n")

# we are done. As such, we are not going to get here as the above loop
# is a forever loop.
f.close()
consumer.close()
